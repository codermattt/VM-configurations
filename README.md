# VM-configurations
This repository contains the process and configuration files for setting up Virtual Machines (VMs) manually and automatically. These setups have helped me understand infrastructure as code, and gave me hands on experience with virtualization; as these are foundational concepts for a successful devops career

## Repo Structure
- manual-setup: Instructions for manually setting up Ubuntu and CentOS VMs using VirtualBox.
- auto-setup: Automated VM provisioning using Vagrant and Vagrantfiles.

## Getting Started
Each folder contains its own setup instructions in Markdown format. They have the configurations I used for the setup of my VM's in my local lab environment.

## Notes
This repo is part of my DevOps learning journey and documents both successful and trial-and-error setups for future reference.
